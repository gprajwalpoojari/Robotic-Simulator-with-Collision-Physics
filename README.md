Some Background on Braitenberg Vehicle:
A Braitenberg vehicle is an agent that can autonomously move around based on its sensor inputs. 
It has primitive sensors that measure some stimulus at a point, and wheels (each driven by its own motor) that function as actuators or effectors. 
In the simplest configuration, a sensor is directly connected to an effector, so that a sensed signal immediately produces a movement of the wheel.
